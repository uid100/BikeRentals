# BikeRentals
Concept development for Bike Rental shop.

Bike Rentals


Larry & David went on vacation in Kaua'i from Indiana. The weather is close to 78 - 82 degrees all year around and they've decided they're staying!

They were stunned at the cost of rental cars in a post-Covid world. The average speed limit around the island is about 30 mph, but even around the beach towns, there are hills. The electric bike market has blown up and they have a college friend in Singapore that can source top-end electric bikes with large tires suitable for the roads and hills in two adult sizes which can be shipped and delivered for close to $2k each, and they can rent them for $75/day. If they stretch their budget, they can start with twenty (20) of these (10 each, large and medium for smaller adults), including overhead startup expenses.

They found a small shop in a popular tourist area with plenty outdoor space to open a shop with a storage shed to keep their inventory locked up at night, including the rack of t-shirts they hope to sell. Together, they have a little money from graduation gifts and from selling their cars on the mainland.

This could work!


They need to put the idea into motion.

Here's a start at their 
## Requirements:

- They need a web application to attract customers to their business. It should highlight some of the attractions accessible to their first location near Po'ipu Beach which is close to Koloa town and several resorts there. It should also quote some positive happy customer reviews.
- The application needs to allow visitors to reserve rentals and track availability.
- The rental form should enable the customer to enter requested dates, number of days, number of bicycles (large or small), and provide a rental cost contract and liability waiver.
- They want to offer a 10% discount code for special offers and returning guests, so the rental form should include a discount code entry.
- The application will need a database to store customers' contact information and (encrypted) payment information.
- They want to generate monthly emails to their interested customers and past guests.
- The application needs to keep track of their bike inventory and include a form display showing which are rented, reserved, out for maintenance, or available for any specified day.
- For now, the system will only support full-day rentals and will not need to track partial day rentals
- In addition to reservations -including handling payments, the system should generate an final invoice for the user when the bike is returned.



### Assignments
- Our department has the contract to make this happen, but we will accomplish this in groups. 

- What data needs to be collected/maintained/stored/viewed?
- What views are needed? Who will be using each?
- What are the individual components to be built?
- Eng: Are the bikes level-priced? tier-pricing? by size? are some days at a premium?
